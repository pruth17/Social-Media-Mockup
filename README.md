# Social-Media-Mockup
Used a graph to design and implement an application that maintains the data for a simple social network. 
Each person in the network should has a profile that contains the person’s name, current status, and a list of friends. 
Application allows a user to join the network, leave the network, create a profile, modify the profile, search for other profiles, and add friends. 
Tracked the friend relationships among members of the network. 
Added a feature to enable people to see a list of their friends’ friends.
The project is implemented using GUI – Graphical User Interface of Java programming.
